# A list of IDA Plugins

* [Adobe Flash disassembler](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/SWF/ReadMe.txt): The 2 plugins present in this archive will enable IDA to parse SWF files, load all SWF tags as segments for fast search and retrieval, parse all tags that can potentially contain ActionScript2 code, discover all such code(a dedicated processor module has been written for it) and even name the event functions acording to event handled in it (eg. OnInitialize). [Download](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/SWF/swf.zip)

* [DWARF Plugin](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/IDADwarf-0.2/README): IDADWARF is an IDA plugin that imports DWARF debugging symbols into an IDA database. [Download](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/IDADwarf-0.2/idadwarf-0.2.zip)

* [IDA2SQL](https://github.com/zynamics/ida2sql-plugin-ida): As the name implies this plugin can be used to export information from IDA databases to SQL databases. This allows for further analysis of the collected data: statstical analysis, building graphs, finding similarities between programs, etc.

* [IDA Stealth](http://newgre.net/idastealth): IDAStealth is a plugin which aims to hide the IDA debugger from most common anti-debugging techniques. The plugin is composed of two files, the plugin itself and a dll which is injected into the debuggee as soon as the debugger attaches to the process. The injected dll actually implements most of the stealth techniques either by hooking system calls or by patching some flags in the remote process.

* [IDA Toolbag](https://github.com/aaronportnoy/toolbag): The IDA Toolbag plugin provides many handy features, such as:
  * A 'History' view, that displays functions in the disassembly that you have decided are important, and the relationships between them.
  * A code path-searching tool, that lets you find what functions (or blocks) are forming a path between two locations.
  * Manage and run your IDC/Python scripts
  * Something that's also of considerable importance is that the IDA Toolbag lets you collaborate with other IDA users: one can publish his 'History', or import another user's history & even merge them!
  * See the official documentation for an extensive feature list.

* [MyNav](https://code.google.com/p/mynav/): MyNav is a plugin for IDA Pro to help reverse engineers in the most typical task like discovering what functions are responsible of some specifical tasks, finding paths between "interesting" functions and data entry points.

* [Optimice](https://code.google.com/p/optimice/): This plugin enables you to remove some common obfuscations and rewrite code to a new segment. Currently supported optimizations are: Dead code removal, JMP merging, JCC opaque predicate removal, Pattern based deobfuscations

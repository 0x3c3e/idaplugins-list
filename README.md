# A list of IDA Plugins

* [DWARF Plugin](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/IDADwarf-0.2/README): IDADWARF is an IDA plugin that imports DWARF debugging symbols into an IDA database. [Download](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/IDADwarf-0.2/idadwarf-0.2.zip)
* [Adobe Flash disassembler](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/SWF/ReadMe.txt): The 2 plugins present in this archive will enable IDA to parse SWF files, load all SWF tags as segments for fast search and retrieval, parse all tags that can potentially contain ActionScript2 code, discover all such code(a dedicated processor module has been written for it) and even name the event functions acording to event handled in it (eg. OnInitialize). [Download](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2009/SWF/swf.zip)
* [IDA Stealth](http://newgre.net/idastealth): IDAStealth is a plugin which aims to hide the IDA debugger from most common anti-debugging techniques. The plugin is composed of two files, the plugin itself and a dll which is injected into the debuggee as soon as the debugger attaches to the process. The injected dll actually implements most of the stealth techniques either by hooking system calls or by patching some flags in the remote process.
